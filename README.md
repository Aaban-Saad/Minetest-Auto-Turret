# Auto Turret for Minetest
This is a Lua script designed to run in a Lua controller within Minetest, enabling players to create a buildable cannon that can automatically detect and shoot at players or other entities.

## Why
I dunno.

## Troubleshooting
- If your cannon rotates opposite to the target, then add a minus sign before the cannon's rotation in the code, or build everything again facing 180Â° backward.
- The camera and the target must be on the same level to be detected correctly.
- Make sure the name the digiline channels correctly. Reffer to the youtube video.
